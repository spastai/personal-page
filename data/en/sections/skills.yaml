  summary: |
    I favour metrics due its shorter path to actions 
    (alerts in simpliest form and trends, root cause analysis or preventive actions
    in more complicated cases). Thus Grafana and Proetheus are used pretty heavily.
    Even with Elastic I will aim for the dashboards to feel the pulse. With tracing 
    worked mainly with Elastic APM.

    Ability to trace quickly down to source code is significant in quick problem resolution.

    branches, binaries or history which might add extra downtime.
